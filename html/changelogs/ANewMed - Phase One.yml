changes: 
  - experiment: "Medical Overhaul: Phase One"
  - rscadd: "Organs and limbs have more health, in general."
  - rscadd: "Organs take semi-permanent damage, called scarring. Scarring prevents the organ from having less that a certain amount of damage, though it heals slowly after the organ hasn't taken damage for a while."
  - rscadd: "Wounds on limbs also take scarring, which heals slowly after the wound hasn't taken damage for a while. This means limbs can't be perfectly fixed in one go, and will require time after treatment to fully heal."
  - rscadd: "Wounds with embedded objects (ie. Bullets) do not naturally heal scarring, and as such cannot be healed."
  - rscadd: "Broken bones can be fixed even if their limb has enough damage to be broken, but they will rebreak if the limb takes more damage at this point."
  - rscadd: "Station methods for bone repair leave the bone more vulnerable to breaking for a few minutes."
  - rscadd: "Most abnormal (read: Antag-only) methods of healing work roughly the same as before, meaning they won't have to worry about scarring or bone fragility."
